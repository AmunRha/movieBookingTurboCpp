# movieBookingTurboCpp
This is my school project made with couple of team mates. This was intended for Turbo C++ compiler. Too much graphics and animations in place XD

ps please dont mind, 
- the unclean code
- absence of any comments
- useless logics
- bad algorithms
- too much unecessary "graphics"
- bad handling of versions, stages and modules

### Proof that it worked !
